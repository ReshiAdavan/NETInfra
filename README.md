# NETInfra

After gaining experience in SWE, I realized the importance behind agile engineering and communication between various industries of IT - SWE, DevOps, etc. I personally believe the lack of agile and communication causes obstacles that many companies face, which is completely okay!

So, although its prevalance and contribution to society is minimal, I felt like creating an application that helps us developers resolve issues we often face on a day-to-day basis; monitoring technology, debugging access and errors, etc., was a way where I can personalize the application of relevant industry skills to help others. 

Hence the creation of NETInfra, a infrastructure management tool for software teams. 

P.S: I decided to expand on my CommandSnippetAPI project by adding more services and microservice architecture. Safe to say it was not easy. 

### Features

- A nifty 'backend' microservice which monitors Command Snippets and Platforms. 
- Includes load balancing and messaging brokers to automatically route and update data to each of the services, which are stored in SQL and in-mem DBs. 

### Skills

- Programming languages: C#
- Libraries/Frameworks: ASP.NET, Entity Framework
- Database: SQL and in-mem DBs
- Other: Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, gRPC
